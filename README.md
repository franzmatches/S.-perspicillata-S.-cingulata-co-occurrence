The data consists of a spreadsheet excel file containing six sheets. 
1. "Experiment outcome": table with laboratory experiments outcome. The experimental protocol consisted in 3-day procedure: on day 1, an individual of S. cingulata was placed in a smaller “test” terrarium (39x28x14cm) filled with a thin layer of leaf litter coming from the “home” terraria which included two identical shelters (6x4 cm tiles) placed at opposite sides of the enclosure (Figure 2). This allowed the animal to settle under one of the two shelters. On day 2, one S. perspicillata individual was placed in the centre of the “test” terrarium, left free to choose which shelter to use. The room was kept at a constant temperature of 16°C and 90% relative humidity, the artificial lights were programmed to replicate the natural photoperiod. On day 3, the terrarium was checked in the morning when the lights had been on for a couple of hours to ensure the animals were under a shelter, and the position of the individuals was recorded. After each experiment, the tiles were cleaned to remove any odorous or chemical cues that could have been left. In the table, Outcome = 0: the two species used separated tiles; Outcome = 1: the two species co-occurred under the same tile

2. Sampling15.10.2009: presence/absence data for the two species under 22 natural shelters (stones) in the sampled field site performed on the date specified in the sheet title. The stones are numbered from 1 to 22. Stones of the 22 that did not contain either of the species were not considered in the matrices.
